# Customer_Churn_Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a subscription-based service. Leveraging machine learning techniques and historical customer data, I developed predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning based on their usage behavior and demographics. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation. By deploying these models, businesses can proactively retain customers and improve profitability.
